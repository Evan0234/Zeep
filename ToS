Zeep Bot Terms of Service

Welcome to Zeep, a Discord bot designed to assist with server moderation and management. By using Zeep, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service. These terms apply to all users and administrators who interact with the bot.

Zeep offers a variety of commands for both general users and administrators. General commands include /hello, which sends a greeting message, /ticket to open a new support ticket, /verify to send a verification code to the user, and /verifycode to verify the user's code. Administrative commands include /ban to ban a user from the server, /kick to kick a user from the server, /clear to clear messages in a channel, /timeout to timeout a specified user, /warn to issue a warning to a user, /unwarn to remove a warning from a user, /unban to unban a user, /tempban to temporarily ban a user, /say to make the bot send a message in a specified channel, /close to close a ticket, /delete to delete a ticket, /open to reopen a closed ticket, and /cmds to list all available commands.

Zeep collects and processes user data to provide its services. This includes user IDs and usernames for identifying users, message content for commands like /clear, /say, and ticket management, timestamps for logging interactions, server and channel IDs to identify where commands are executed, and verification codes for user verification processes. The data collected is used for user management, service improvement, and security. It is stored securely and only accessible to authorized administrators.

Users must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. They should use commands appropriately and avoid spamming or abusing the bot’s features. Users should report any bugs or issues to the server administrators. Prohibited actions include spamming commands, abusing administrative power, and sharing or generating inappropriate content using the bot.

Rule enforcement includes warnings for minor infractions, with each warning resulting in a 15-minute timeout. Multiple warnings can lead to kicks or temporary bans: 3 warnings result in a kick, 6 warnings result in a 1-week ban, 8 warnings result in a 2-week ban, and 11 warnings result in a permanent ban. Severe offenses such as harassment or abuse can result in immediate bans.

Zeep is provided as-is, and while we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee the reliability or completeness of the bot’s responses. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use of Zeep. By using Zeep, you agree to waive any right to file a lawsuit or any form of legal action against the creators, developers, or administrators of Zeep.

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes. Users who violate these terms may have their access to Zeep restricted or terminated. If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms of Service, please contact the server administrators.

These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable worldwide, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
